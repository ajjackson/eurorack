   | 4-band EQ               | Concept         | Not that interesting compared to Emphasis;              |
   |                         |                 | complex if analogue                                     |

   | Digipot pole-mixing VCF | Concept         | Needs more distinction from existing stuff;             |
   |                         |                 | ok, digipot implementation is different but             |
   |                         |                 | features same as Polaris, SMR4P                         |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | Rungler                 | Stop            | 8-bit cipher should suit me well                        |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | Bussed clock div        | Early concept   |                                                         |

   | Clippers                | Building blocks | Redundancy, choosing best combination!                  |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | BYO wavefold            | Early concept   | Not happy with initial schematic ideas                  |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | Rectifiers              | Schematic       | Good synergy with Scanner, wait for that                |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | Switching filter        | Early concept   | Figure out relationship with VCOs. Inbuilt?             |
   |                         |                 | Multi-rectify external? Barton SRV looks                |
   |                         |                 | very interesting.                                       |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | VCO: harmonic FM        | Concept         | Rectifiers & Scanner break out subunits of this         |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | DCO                     | Early concept   | Get an AS3397 and play with it. What are the            |
   |                         |                 | real advantages over pure digital? 3397 signal          |
   |                         |                 | path is funny, can't quite use VCO & VCF                |
   |                         |                 | independently. Resonant filter FM could make            |
   |                         |                 | an interesting "VCO" block.                             |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | Digital 4-op FM         | Early concept   | Need to get more experience with Daisy VCO              |
   |                         |                 | programming. Challenge deciding panel/controls.         |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | PWM VCA                 | Early concept   | High freq is scary! Concept needs tightening.           |
   |                         |                 | Might just sound bad and not add much over OTA?         |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
   | AS3350 dual filter      | Early concept   | Marsupial exists, need some novel vowel filter controls |
   |                         |                 |                                                         |
