# ajjackson's DIY synth stuff

Somewhere to capture and develop some ideas for novel synthesiser
modules. Currently that means Eurorack, so +/- 12V power, TS mini
jacks, 10V peak-to-peak audio signals.

Not clear at this stage if the end goal is perfboard or PCBs, will see
how ambitious the designs get...
